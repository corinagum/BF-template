This directory contains various sample cards to be used for testing, transfered from Bot Framework MockBot.

## NOTE: New card should **NOT** be added to the `Cards/` directory.

## Adaptive Cards

Although Adaptive Cards are a type of rich card, we have so many of them that we sort them out into a separate category.

Many of these cards are sample [Adaptive Cards](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/) provided by the AC project. These cards may or may not be up-to-date with the originals.

Adaptive Cards are sorted by schema, to more easily find cards of a specific schema to test. Please maintain this format in the future.

## Bot Framework Schema (Rich)Cards

Rich Cards refer to non-Adaptive Cards
